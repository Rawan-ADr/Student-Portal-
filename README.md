Developed a Student Portal system using Laravel framework, enabling students to submit and track university requests electronically instead of traditional paper-based processes. The system supports document management, request processing through a dynamic workflow based on employee roles, and automated eligibility checks for request submission.
The architecture was designed following MVC with 3-Layers (Controller, Service, Repository) to ensure flexibility and maintainability. Additional features include lectures management, grade records, online payment, administrative review, and activity tracking to ensure transparency and reliability.
